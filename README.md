# audiobook-speedup

Scripts for speeding up audiobooks.

These were created when I was using my old android phone to listen to audiobooks that came from CD. Speeding them up before-hand allowed more audio to be stored on the phone, while also allowing less CPU utilization.

There are a few versions of the scripts, some that run just on windows, while others use cygwin.
